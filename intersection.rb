    # put timing logic here
    # when do we have to clear the opposing lane of traffic
    #   o  given wasted seconds at one light and useful seconds
    #      at another, try to maximize number of total useful seconds
    #      total = useful + wasted
    #      but how do i figure out which timing sequence is best?
    #   o  need a predictor of how long a light will be accumulating
    #      wasted seconds or useful seconds
    #   x  form continuous stretches of traffic by "blurring" short
    #      distances (that are based on speed limit/realtime speed and
    #      the timing of the yellow lights)
    #   x  don't give a green if there's nowhere for the cars to go
    #      on the other side
    #   o  since boilerplate reduction is the same for both traffic
    #      currents, then whether traffic flows instantaneously or not
    #      shouldn't matter. so then yellow lights shouldn't matter?
    #      except they do matter for blurring.
    #   o  total seconds ‚àù # of cars on the road - # of potential car spots
    #   o  what's the motivation for the light to even switch? if there is
    #      continuous traffic on both roads, why switch the light?
    #      ^^^ this is key
    #   o  if you have a continuous flow of traffic, crosstraffic will take
    #      crossing time + delay
    #   o  if a light is limited to be max 30 seconds of wasted seconds,
    #      then should it only be looking at the next 30 seconds of traffic?
    #   o  longer lights mean more time spent at the speed limit and less time
    #      spent speeding up and slowing down, so preference is given to
    #      longer lights
    #   x  which means light switching is really at the mercy of the random
    #      holes in traffic
    #   o  is there any difference between doing discrete 30 sec chunks and
    #      doing a running 30-sec look? yes
    #   o  can't do a running look. it would change too frequently. need to
    #      do a 30-sec lookahead, decide when in the next 30 sec to change,
    #      and then do another 30-sec lookahead at that point (which may
    #      occur 15 sec in). Q. is this true? A. no. i do a running look now
    #   o  maybe instead of measuring time spent with cars waiting at the
    #      light, i should be measuring the time like that AND the speed
    #      that is lower than the speed limit? but this violates the
    #      assumption that cars go from 0 to speed limit (instantly?)
    #   x  okay, don't worry about the speed below the speed limit because
    #      while the value of "wasted seconds" might no longer be accurate
    #      as an absolute value, it will still be accurate when compared to
    #      the other light's wasted seconds
    #   x  ^^^ further made difficult because sometimes traffic simply doesn't
    #      flow at the rate of the speed limit, but it doesn't mean that that
    #      time should be counted as delay, per se
    #   x  wasted seconds = delay while no cross traffic
    #   x  there is always greater longterm benefit for having fewer light
    #      transitions. therefore, in a worst-case scenario of a solid stream
    #      of cars from one direction, all algorithms will suggest that they
    #      let the constant stream continue.
    #   x  the only way to stop that is to have a maximum wait time for any
    #      car, which will be specific to the nature of the sinusoidal nature
    #      of traffic for each road. i.e., a solid stream of traffic means you
    #      wait 3 minutes. since traffic isn't truly a solid stream of cars,
    #      the best number is somewhere less than that, depending on its
    #      porosity.
    #   o  porosity would be an interesting measurement of traffic
    #   o  how to get entire roads operating with like minds? isn't that
    #      what blurs are supposed to do?
    #   x  if cars start from a standstill, they can start as a blur, and then
    #      they spread out. how to account for that? need to allow cars to go
    #      above speed limit in order to catch up
    #   o  what about when a blur starts far enough back that singletons can
    #      make it across? TODO
    #   o  lights are turning mid-blur (new blur, caused by a red, can take
    #      priority from completing a blur) TODO
